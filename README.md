---
An investigation on the relationship between American's marital status and other factors, such as educational level and personal income, personal wages, nationnality, geographical region and so on. (year 2013) 



The project will keep on being updated, since it is not a homework(actually this is an abandonded project of my [applied data science](http://www.columbia.edu/cu/bulletin/uwb/subj/STAT/W4249-20161-001/) course, but I just want to continue on this topic:) ). 


I will try to update it every time I have some new idea on certain variables.
